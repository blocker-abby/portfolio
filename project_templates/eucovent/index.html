                <h2>About the Project:</h2>
                <p>The Eucovent project was started as an undergraduate group capstone project at the University of South Florida (USF). The student team consisted of myself, Carolyna Yamamoto Alves Pinto, and Jacob Yarinsky, and we were supported by USF Medical Engineering and Moffitt Cancer Center. The project aimed to build a device that could allow one ventilator to support multiple patients. This was particularly relevant at the inception of the project, which was in 2020 at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
                <p>With the help of Drs Chris Passaglia, Souheil Zekri, Stefano Pasetto, Heiko Enderling, and Aaron Muncey, our team developed a working prototype which won several awards and gained national attention. A <a href="https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/41/5c/a3/b76a897ee4f669/US20240366908A1.pdf">patent</a> was filed for the device and <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2024/08/07/2024.08.06.24311558.full.pdf">animal trials</a> were conducted.</p>
                <p>The project won the <a href="https://www.nibib.nih.gov/programs/division-interdisciplinary-training-didt/debut/2021-winners">first place Steven H. Krosnick award in the 2021 NIH NIBIB DEBUT Competition</a>, <a href="https://www.usf.edu/entrepreneurship/initiatives/innovation-technology/">first place in the Jabil Innovation Technology Challenge</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/FloridaVentureForum/posts/congratulations-to-the-2021-earlystage-winning-companiesgrand-prize-winner-calcu/4287381377981564/">first place in the Florida Venture Forum Collegiate Startup Competition</a>, and first place in the USF Medical Engineering Capstone Project awards. Below are some relevant links and videos demonstrating the device with myself and other team members.</p>
