            <h2>About the Project:</h2>
            <p>A subset of my PhD work focused on building and deploying a language translation system to support virtual clinic services. This is relevant as doctors begin to connect to patients in various geographic areas, which may mean they speak different languages. Given that the system was designed for African contexts, research into translation systems for these languages was researched.</p>
            <p>In particular, the South African language of isiXhosa was chosen to focus on as it was most relevant to the project's immediate contexts of implementation. Research was conducted into the availability and accuracy of machine translation and automatic speech recognition algorithms for isiXhosa. More about the research and results can be found <a href="https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2025.cl4health-1.14">in this publication</a>.</p>
            <p>Through this research, an audiotextual dataset was developed for health domain contexts. The dataset consists of mock primary health consults in both English and isiXhosa, spoken by South African actors. The dataset is available for researchers to use and build upon, to promote development and evaluation of tools to support communication in health contexts.
