            <p>The camera can be used to send real-time video and images, either as an otoscope (for ear, nose, and throat images) or a dermascope (for skin images). To use the camera as an otoscope, the black otoscope base should be used, and the disposable otoscope tip attached to the top of the base. A new otoscope tip should be used for each patient. There are two sizes of tips, large and small, which come in clear packaging. The larger tip has a wider diameter head than the smaller tip. To use the camera as a dermascope, the clear dermascope base should be used. There is a cap on the base, which should be removed to take images and replaced once completed. When attaching the dermascope base, slowly twist the base around until the groove fits smoothly into the groove of the camera. Do not force the clear dermascope base onto the camera head. </p>

            <img src="/static/images/Camera Otoscope Tips.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy">
            <p>The camera can zoom in and out on the subject by rolling the grey, ridged dial on the side of the camera. The light brightness can be controlled with the thin, black dial at the bottom of the device (near the wire). The bases are attached at the camera head.  The wire on the camera ends with a USB connector. This connector should be plugged into the laptop when ready to use. The system will automatically pick up that the camera has been plugged in, and allow the user to switch cameras to this camera view. While the medical camera is turned on, both the webcam view and the medcial camera will be streamed to the remote side, and this is demonstrated on the platform. </p>

            <h2>Stethoscope</h2>
            <a href="#quicklinks">Back to Top</a><br>
            <p>The digital stethoscope can be used to send real-time audio from the patient. It can be used as a typical stethoscope, by placing the stethoscope diaphragm on the chest and abdomen to hear body sounds. The eartube can be used for the local user who is with the patient, to hear the sounds. The aux/USB connection can be plugged into the computer to send the sounds to the remote user (doctor). The eartube port on the stethoscope body has a headphones icon and is on the top of the device. The connection port is slightly on the side of the device, and has a wire icon.</p>
            <img src="/static/images/Stethoscope Full - Marked.png" alt="" loading="lazy">
            <img src="/static/images/Stethoscope On Off - Marked.png" alt="" loading="lazy">
            <p>The stethoscope can be turned off and on with the power button on the side. When on, the light on the front and back of the stethoscope body will glow white. When off, the light will not glow. The volume can be controlled by the + and - buttons on the side of the device. The device is battery powered and has a micro-USB port for charging. When the device battery is low, the lights on the body will glow red when the device is turned on. When charging, a red light indicates charging, and green light indicates a full charge. It is recommended to charge the device at least once a month (even when the device is not in use) to maintain the battery level, otherwise there is a risk of depleting the battery and needing replacement. </p>
            <img src="/static/images/Stethoscope Ports Buttons - Marked.png" alt="" loading="lazy">
            <p>For the connection port, some computers will not recognize the device using the aux connection only. Therefore, an aux→USB connection has been provided. This is a small black connection which has an aux port at the bottom and a USB at the other end. This USB plugs into the computer so that the computer will recognize the device. Once plugged in, the application will recognize the stethoscope device and automatically allow the user to switch to this audio. When the stethoscope audio is playing, the other side will not hear the computer microphone (and will not hear the user speaking). </p>

            <h2>Vital Signs Monitor</h2>
            <a href="#quicklinks">Back to Top</a><br>
            <p>The vital signs monitor measures pulse oxygen level (SpO2), heart rate (HR), blood pressure, and temperature. It also measures ECG and respiration rate, which are discussed in the ECG section. The ports are color-coded (green and blue) based on the connection, with green being the ECG and temperature probe and blue being the SpO2 and HR probe. To connect the probes, gently slide the connector into the port, and twist to align the grooves. Do not force the connector into the port. The connector will make a click when it is fully connected. To remove the connector, gently pull on the grey connector until the connector slides out. For the blood pressure cuff, there is a white connector which should enter the middle port. Ensure that the metal part with the up arrow is fully pushed in before attempting to connect the blood pressure cuff. The blood pressure connector will click when it is fully connected. To release the blood pressure cuff, press the metal part with the up arrow and remove the connector. </p>

            <img src="/static/images/Vitals Monitor Pulse Ox.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy">
            <p>The pulse oximeter should be placed on the finger with the finger icon side on the back of the hand (not the palm). The finger should be placed fully into the pulse oximeter, with the fingertip touching the opposite side. The blood pressure reading should not be taken on the same side at the same time as the pulse oximeter, or results may be incorrect. </p>
            <img src="/static/images/Vitals Monitor User Interface - Marked.png" alt="" loading="lazy">
            <img src="/static/images/Vitals Monitor ECG Cable.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy">
            <p>The vital signs monitor can be turned on by pressing the grey selector button in the middle of the device. Once turned on, the selector button can be used to navigate through the selections on the bottom of the screen using short presses of the button. From left to right, the selections are: alarms on/off, Bluetooth on/off, start blood pressure test, power on/off. The currently selected icon will be larger than the other icons. To select the icon, long press the selector button for 2 seconds. This will change the state of the on/off buttons, or in the case of the blood pressure test, will trigger the start of the blood pressure test. If there is no blood pressure cuff plugged in, the test will not trigger. Starting the test will inflate the cuff and take the blood pressure reading. The test will be approximately 10 seconds, and when completed will output a reading next to the SYS and DIA headings on the interface. </p>
            <p>When the pulse oximeter is plugged in, and the patient has the monitor on, a heart rate plot will begin to appear in the top third of the screen with a red line. After approximately 10-15 seconds, the pulse oximeter and heart rate values will then be displayed (next to SpO2 and HR labels, respectively). These will continuously change as they are monitoring the patient in real time. Similarly, the temperature monitor can be connected and the probe (small black circular piece on the ECG wire) placed in the armpit of the patient. The temperature will take approximately 60 seconds to get the temperature of the patient. Once the temperature stops changing, or is centring around a common value, this can be used as the patient's temperature. </p>
            <p>All of these measurements are recorded in the patient's record by manually typing the values into the consultation platform. The values will automatically be sent to the remote user in real-time during the consultation. </p>

                <li>Alcohol pads</li>
            </ul>
            <ol>
                <li>Plug in the pulse oximeter, blood pressure cuff, and/or ECG/temperature cable (depending on which measurements are desired). When plugging in the blue/green cables, twist the cable base around the port until the grooves align and then push in. Do not force the cable ends into the port. For the blood pressure cuff, ensure that the metal piece with the arrow has been pushed in toward the port in order to open the port for the blood pressure cuff to be plugged in.</li>
                <li>Clean the monitors to be used on the patient with an alcohol wipe (finger monitor, cuff, temperature probe). </li>
                <li>Turn on the vital signs monitor using the grey button in the centre of the device.</li>
                <li>If collecting heart rate or SpO2, place the patient's finger inside the monitor, ensuring the fingertip touches the edge of the opposite end. Ensure that the fingertip icon is on the backside of the hand, not the palm side. </li>
                <li>The heart rate should now appear on screen as a waveform. Allow approximately 10 seconds for the HR and SpO2 measurements to appear on screen. </li>
                <li>If collecting blood pressure, place the cuff on the patient's arm. Ensure the patient is sitting, relaxed, and their legs are uncrossed. Do not take the HR and SpO2 measurements at the same time as the blood pressure. </li>
                <li>To start the blood pressure exam, press the middle grey button on the vital signs monitor until the blood pressure icon (3rd icon from the left) is highlighted. Long press on the grey button to start the test. </li>
                <li>Wait for the test to complete. The systolic and diastolic measurements will appear onscreen once the test is complete. If the measurements do not appear, it means the test has failed - ensure that the cuff is plugged in properly and placed correctly on the patient. </li>
                <li>If collecting the patient temperature, place the temperature probe in the armpit of the patient and have the patient close their armpit over the wire. Monitor the temperature reading on the device until it maintains a steady value (approximately 1 minute).</li>
                <li>Record any of the necessary measurements in the notes panel on the consultation platform. </li>
                <li>To record and send ECG data, review the 'How To Collect ECG Data' guide.</li>
                <li>When the examination is completed, remove the monitor/cuff/probe from the patient. To remove the cables, gently pull the cable base from the port. For the cuff, press the metal tab with the arrow to release the cable. Clean off the materials with an alcohol wipe.</li>
                <li>Navigate to the power option on the selection menu using the grey selector button. When the power button is highlighted, long press to select, turning off the device.</li>
                <li>Store the device and cables securely.</li>

            <h2>ECG</h2>
            <a href="#quicklinks">Back to Top</a><br>
            <p>The ECG measurements are taken from the vital signs monitor, but because they cannot be manually typed in, there are further steps that need to be taken to send the data to the remote user. The patient should be attached to the ECG leads using the disposable electrodes. The electrodes should be clipped to the ECG leads before placing the electrodes on the patient. </p>
            <img src="/static/images/ECG Placement.png" alt="" loading="lazy">
            <p>There are 3 leads of the ECG: white right arm (RA), black left arm (LA), and red left foot (LL). They are placed to form Einthoven's triangle. The RA and LA electrodes should be placed under the clavicle, on the 2nd intercostal space, in line with one another but on their respective sides. The LL electrode should be placed on the lower left abdomen (does not need to be placed on the foot, despite its name).</p>
            <img src="/static/images/Vitals Monitor ECG Cable.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy">
            <p>Once the electrodes are placed, the vital signs monitor should be turned on (if not already on). If the electrodes have been placed properly, the respiration rate (RR) measurement will appear. The Bluetooth module must be used to read the ECG data. The virtual clinic has a local program which should be run on the computer to get the results. This will already be running in the background. The ECG panel can then be opened on the consult platform. 'Start ECG' will start the ECG test. To prevent failure of the test, ensure that the Bluetooth module on the device is blinking in the top right corner near the battery symbol. If you do not see the Bluetooth symbol, select it on the selector menu with the selector button. The test will return an ECG waveform to the consultation platform which is automatically shared with the remote user. The ECG test can be repeated multiple times. Note that the ECG waveform will not appear on the vital signs monitor in the top third of the screen; this waveform will be the heart rate only. There is no way to display the ECG waveform directly on the PM6100 device. </p>

            <h2>Blood Test</h2>
            <a href="#quicklinks">Back to Top</a><br>
            <p>The Accu-Answer blood test kit contains 4 different blood tests: uric acid, total cholesterol, haemoglobin, and blood glucose. The test devices are included in the black zipper pouch, and the test strips are in the blue Accu-Answer box in their respective containers. Each test strip container displays a two-digit code on the back, which allows for calibration of the device. The device will already be calibrated, but if there are consistent errors with using the device it may need to be recalibrated using these figures. Instructions on how to calibrate are provided in the pack. </p>
            <img src="/static/images/Blood Test Full - Marked.png" alt="" loading="lazy">
            <p>The test device contains a port for the test strips and an eject button on the top to remove test strips once the testing is completed. There are also disposable lancets to be used in the lancing device to draw blood from the patient. The lancing device has a twisting head which allows for control of the depth of the needle, a plunger to load the lancet once it is placed inside, and the lancing button to deploy the lancet (pierce the patient). Once the lancet has been used, the head of the lancing device can be removed by pulling up and twisting. The lancet ejector can be slid up to remove the lancet safely. Only one lancet per patient should be used, and the lancets should be disposed of properly. The lancing device should be cleaned between each patient. </p>
            <img src="/static/images/Blood Test Device - Marked.png" alt="" loading="lazy">
            <p>Some of the tests require a larger volume of blood. Ensure that enough blood is drawn from the patient before placing the blood on the test strip, otherwise an error will result. If the test fails, remove the test strip, draw more blood from the patient, and place a new test strip to try the test again. All results should be recorded manually in the consultation notes.</p>
            <p>Make sure to keep the lid of the test strip container closed when not in use. Exposure to light can reduce the effectiveness of the test strips. </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Blood test zipper pouch, which includes:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lancing device</li>
                    <li>Disposable lancets</li>
                    <li>Blood test device</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Blood test strip containers</li>
                <li>Alcohol pads</li>
                <li>Plaster or cotton for puncture site (optional)</li>
            </ul>
            <ol>
                <li>Clean your hands and the patient's hands.</li>
                <li>Prepare the lancing device. Remove the lancet head by twisting anti-clockwise and pulling from the lancet body. </li>
                <li>Place a new lancet into the lancet body. Twist off the cap of the lancet to remove it and expose the lancet needle. </li>
                <li>Replace the lancet head by twisting it clockwise back onto the lancet body. </li>
                <li>Clean the lancet head using an alcohol pad. </li>
                <li>Prepare the test strip and testing device. Place the desired testing strip into the test strip port of the left side of the testing device. </li>
                <li>Collect the blood from the patient by first cleaning the piercing site with an alcohol pad. Adjust the lancing device depth appropriately. Pull back the plunger of the lancing device. </li>
                <li>Place the lancing device head against the piercing site finger. When ready, press the button on the side of the lancing device to deploy the lancet and pierce the finger. Remove the device and squeeze out a large drop of blood on the patient's finger.</li>
                <li>Place the test strip against the blood drop to soak the blood on the testing strip. A countdown should start displaying on the testing device. Note that a large drop of blood is needed for the test. If an error displays on the device instead of a countdown, the likely reason for error is because the blood drop was not enough. Repeat the test with a larger amount of blood.</li>
                <li>Clean off the patient finger with an alcohol pad and place the plaster or cotton on the puncture site as necessary. </li>
                <li>Clean the lancing device head with an alcohol pad. </li>
                <li>Repeat as necessary for the desired tests. Note that a drop of blood will be needed for each test. Record the measurements as taken in the notes section of the consultation platform.</li>
                <li>When the examination is completed, carefully remove the lancing device head by twisting anti-clockwise and pulling the head off. Remove the lancet by sliding the grey remover up on the lancing device and dispose of the needle properly. Replace the head of the lancing device.</li>
                <li>Remove the test strip from the device by pressing the eject button on the top of the testing device. Dispose of the test strip properly. </li>
                <li>Replace all materials back in the zipper pouch and stow away the zipper pouch and test strips securely.</li>

            <p>The patient record page can be accessed from the homepage menu under 'view patient records.' The desired patient can be searched and the book icon can be clicked to go to their record. </p>
            <img src="/static/images/Patient Record Navigation.png" alt="" loading="lazy">
            <p>The patient record page contains a header with the basic demographic patient information, a photo, and patient profile options. Below this are three sections, from left to right: patient charts, consultation data, and patient information. Each of these sections can be minimised to reduce the information on the screen. The charts section contains charts of the measurements recorded for the past 3 visits for SpO2, heart rate, blood pressure, blood glucose, and weight. This can be customised to look at a 6 or 9 visit timespan if desired. The consultations section contains all data from all previous consults, including notes, relevant images, dates, and times. It is displayed in reverse chronological order. Each consultation can be edited to add information after the consultation is completed by pressing the edit button; however, note that information is recorded including a trail of who edited which consultations, and what information was changed. Finally, the patient information includes the medical history as well as contact information for the patient. This can also be edited using the 'edit patient' button in the top right corner. To start a consultation with the patient, the 'start consult' button can be pressed. The 'print/export patient data' button is used to print patient data from the chart or to export it to another digital system. </p>
