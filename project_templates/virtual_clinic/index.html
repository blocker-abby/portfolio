                <h2>About the Project:</h2>
                <p>I started the virtual clinic project in 2022 as a part of my Master's thesis at the University of Cape Town. The original idea centered around creating a virtual clinic system for remote, rural, and underserved areas in South Africa and sub-Saharan Africa. The first iteration of the system was developed during my MSc thesis, where it then underwent usability testing with doctors and nurses. The feedback from these users then guided the development of a second iteration of the system, developed during my PhD. This is the iteration presented here.</p>
                <p>The virtual clinic system is a web application with paired hardware that facilitates provider-to-provider real-time consultations. It is intended to be deployed in rural or low-resource areas where there are minimal to no doctors. Nurses and other healthcare workers can use the system to call an available doctor to consult regarding a patient case. Integrated medical devices support these consultations.</p>
                <p>More about the design, development, and performance of the virtual clinic system can be read about in these publications:</p>
